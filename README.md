Optimize the effective utilization of excess properties owned by

governmental organizations. GA plans to put in place a log-in

system for both administrators and users to provide appropriate

control. Furthermore, a system of filters and searches for surplus

property will be implemented. Creating a simple method for

maintaining the inventory listing is another one of our top

priorities.
